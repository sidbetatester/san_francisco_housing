# san_francisco_housing

This is a python-jupyter notebook integrated development environment(IDE) based Housing Investment Analysis tool to evaluate Rental income to investment per squarefoot in various neighbourhoods of San Francisco. The notebook works as per the standard phases of finacial analysis by extracting data from csv data sources, preparation of datasets by cleaning the data and finally analyzing the data through quantitative analysis and visualizations. We explore the geospatial relationships in the data by using interactive visualizations with hvPlot and GeoViews. The analysis from san-francisco_housing notebook should help you pick a neighborhood for investment and rental income.
